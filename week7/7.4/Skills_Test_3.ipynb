    "Although the opening series (of moves) of a chess game is an outcome space difficult to define clearly, the endgame series of a chess game is an enumerable space. This is the realm within which computer programs are most efficient at defeating a human opponent. The underlying structure of the space can be at least partially characterized by databases of expected final moves. Today we are going to learn the outcome space of the King-Rook vs. King setup. This is the number of moves given the current position until a local guaranteed win.\n",

    "Download [this dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Chess+%28King-Rook+vs.+King%29) and build a prediction of the outcome. The data is given as a series of locations where the values are separated by commas. The locations are given based on a standard chess grid algebraic notation [mapping](http://www.chess-game-strategies.com/chess-grid-systems.html). \n",
